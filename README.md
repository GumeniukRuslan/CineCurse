# CineCurse

CineCurse is a simple React project that showcases my skills in developing web
applications using React. It allows users to explore trending films of the day,
search for films based on a query, and view detailed information about each
film, including the poster, description, reviews, review scores, cast, and
trailer. Additionally, users can easily share a link with others, which includes
all the relevant information, such as the used search query, ensuring that
others can have the same viewing experience.

## Features

- Trending Films: The home page displays the trending films of the day,
  providing users with an overview of popular movies.
- Film Search: The Movies page allows users to search for films by entering a
  search query, making it easy to find specific movies.
- Detailed Film Information: Clicking on a film reveals additional information,
  including the film poster, description, reviews, review scores, cast, and
  trailer.
- Shareable Links: Users can copy and share links that include all the necessary
  information, ensuring that others can access the same film and details.

## Technologies Used

- React: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for
  building user interfaces.
- Themoviedb.org API: Film data is fetched from the Themoviedb.org API,
  providing up-to-date and accurate information.
- React Router: The application utilizes React Router for routing and navigation
  between different pages.
- CSS: Custom CSS styles are used to enhance the visual appeal and user
  experience of the application.
